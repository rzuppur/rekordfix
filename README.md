# Rekordfix

Small utility to add workarounds for missing Rekordbox features. Tested and developed on Windows, in theory should work on other platforms as well, if you find any bugs please create an issue.

- Find tracks from Rekordbox collection that aren't in any playlists
- Find duplicate tracks in playlists
- Find probable duplicates from collection
- Interface to delete/restore track files from disk that have been removed from collection
